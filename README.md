# bloom-filter

> A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by
> Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a
> member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are
> not â€“ in other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely
> not in set." Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this
> can be addressed with the counting Bloom filter variant); the more items
> added, the larger the probability of false positives.
